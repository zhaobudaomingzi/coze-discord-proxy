## Features (The project features are now stable, iterations will not be frequent, feel free to raise an issue if you find bugs!)

- [x] Perfectly compatible with `NextChat`, `one-api`, `LobeChat`, and other chat panels.
- [x] Fully supports conversation isolation.
- [x] Conversation API supports streaming responses.
- [x] Supports creating `discord` categories/channels/threads.
- [x] Supports conversation interfaces aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (also supports `dall-e-3` text-to-image) (supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports image-to-text/image-to-image/file-to-text interfaces aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (using the `GPT4V` request format [supports `url` or `base64`]) (supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports `dall-e-3` text-to-image interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/images/generations`).
- [x] Supports daily tasks at `9` AM to keep the bot active.
- [x] Supports configuring multiple Discord user `Authorization` (environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) for request load balancing (**currently, each Discord user's use of coze-bot is limited to 24 hours, configure multiple users to stack request limits and load balance**).
- [x] Supports configuring multiple coze bots for response load balancing (specified through `PROXY_SECRET`/`model`) see [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for details.

## How to Use

1. Open [Discord's official website](https://discord.com/app), log in, click settings -> advanced settings -> developer mode -> turn on.
2. Create a Discord server, right-click this server to choose `Copy Server ID (GUILD_ID)` and record it, create a default channel in this server, right-click this channel to choose `Copy Channel ID (CHANNEL_ID)` and record it.
3. Open [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
4. Create a new application -> Bot named `COZE-BOT`, and record its exclusive `token` and `id (COZE_BOT_ID)`, this bot will be managed by coze.
5. Create a new application -> Bot named `CDP-BOT`, and record its exclusive `token (BOT_TOKEN)`, this bot will listen for Discord messages.
6. Grant appropriate permissions (`Administrator`) to both bots and invite them to the created Discord server (this process is not described here).
7. Open [Discord's official website](https://discord.com/app), enter the server, press F12 to open developer tools, send a message in any channel, find the request `https://discord.com/api/v9/channels/1206*******703/messages` in the developer tools-`Network`, get `Authorization (USER_AUTHORIZATION)` from the header of this interface and record it.
8. Open [coze's official website](https://www.coze.com) to create a bot and configure it (note `Auto-Suggestion` should be `Default/on` (usually no need to change)).
9. After configuration, choose to publish to Discord, fill in the `COZE-BOT`'s `token`, after publishing, you can see `COZE-BOT` online in the Discord server and can be used with @.
10. Use the recorded parameters to start configuring [environment variables](#environment-variables) and [deploy](#deployment) this project.
11. Access the API documentation address, and you can start debugging or integrating other projects.

## Deployment

### Deploying with Docker-Compose (All In One)

```shell
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```docker
version: '3.4'

services:
  coze-discord-proxy:
    image: deanxv/coze-discord-proxy:latest
    container_name: coze-discord-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "7077:7077"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data
    environment:
      - USER_AUTHORIZATION=MTA5OTg5N************aXUBHVI  # Must be modified to your Discord user's authorization key (multiple keys separated by commas)
      - BOT_TOKEN=MTE5OT************UrUWNbG63w  # Must be modified to the listening bot's token
      - GUILD_ID=11************96  # Must be modified to the server ID where both bots are located
      - COZE_BOT_ID=11************97  # Must be modified to the bot ID managed by coze
      - CHANNEL_ID=11************94  # [Optional] Default channel - (in the current version, this parameter is only used to keep the bot active)
      - PROXY_SECRET=123456  # [Optional] API key - modify this line to the value checked in the request header (multiple keys separated by commas)
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
```

### Deploying with Docker

```docker
docker run --name coze-discord-proxy -d --restart always \
-p 7077:7077 \
-v $(pwd)/data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data \
-e USER_AUTHORIZATION="MTA5OTg5N************uIfytxUgJfmaXUBHVI" \
-e BOT_TOKEN="MTE5OTk2************rUWNbG63w" \
-e GUILD_ID="11************96" \
-e COZE_BOT_ID="11************97" \
-e PROXY_SECRET="123456" \
-e CHANNEL_ID="11************24" \

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Multiple Bots

1. Before deploying, create a `data/config/bot_config.json` file in the same directory as your `docker`/`docker-compose` deployment.
2. Write the following `json` file, `bot_config.json` format as shown below:

```shell
[
  {
    "proxySecret": "123", // API request key (PROXY_SECRET) (Note: this key must exist in the environment variable PROXY_SECRET for this bot to be matched!)
    "cozeBotId": "12***************31", // Bot ID managed by coze
    "model": ["gpt-3.5","gpt-3.5-16k"], // Model names (array format) (matches the `model` in the request body, if the model in the request is not matched in this json, an exception will be thrown)
    "channelId": "12***************56"  // [Optional] Discord channel ID (the bot must be in the server where this channel is located) (in the current version, this parameter is only used to keep the bot active)
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "456",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************64",
    "model": ["gpt-4","gpt-4-16k"],
    "channelId": "12***************78"
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "789",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************12",
    "model": ["dall-e-3"],
    "channelId": "12***************24"
  }
]
```

3. Restart the service.

> When this json configuration is present, it will match the `cozeBotId` through the request header's [request key] + request body's [`model`].
> If multiple matches are found, one will be selected at random. The configuration is very flexible and can be adjusted according to your needs.

For services deployed on third-party platforms (such as `zeabur`) that need [configuring multiple bots], please refer to [issue#30](https://github.com/deanxv/coze-discord-proxy/issues/30).

## Limitations

Current details of coze's free and paid subscriptions: https://www.coze.com/docs/guides/subscription?_lang=en

You can configure multiple Discord user `Authorization` (refer to [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) or [configure multiple bots](#configuring-multiple-bots) to stack request limits and achieve load balancing.

## Q&A

Q: How should I configure the service for high concurrency?

A: First, [configure multiple bots](#configuring-multiple-bots) to be used as response bots for load balancing. Next, prepare multiple Discord accounts for request load balancing and invite them to the same server. Obtain `Authorization` for each account, separate them with commas, and configure them in the environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`. Each request will then pick one Discord account to initiate the conversation, effectively achieving load balancing.
