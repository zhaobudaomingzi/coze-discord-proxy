## Features

- [x] Perfectly adapts to dialogue panels such as `NextChat`, `one-api`, `LobeChat`.
- [x] Perfectly supports dialogue isolation.
- [x] Dialogue interface supports streaming return.
- [x] Supports creating `discord` category/channel/thread.
- [x] Supports the dialogue interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (also supports `dall-e-3`text-to-image) (supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports the picture-to-text/image-to-image/file-to-text interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (according to the request format of `GPT4V` interface [supports `url` or `base64`]) (supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports the `dall-e-3` text-to-image interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/images/generations`).
- [x] Supports the daily `9` o'clock scheduled task to automatically activate the bot.
- [x] Supports configuring multiple discord user `Authorization` (environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) for request load balancing (**Currently each discord user calling coze-bot has a [limit](#Limitations) within 24h, you can configure multiple users to achieve superimposed request times and request load balancing**).
- [x] Supports configuring multiple coze bots for response load balancing (specified by `PROXY_SECRET`/`model`) For details, see [Advanced Configuration](#Advanced-Configuration).

## How to Use

1. Open [Discord official website](https://discord.com/app), after logging in, click on Settings-Advanced Settings-Developer Mode-Turn On.
2. Create a discord server, right-click on this server to select `Copy Server ID (GUILD_ID)` and record it, create a default channel in this server, right-click on this channel to select `Copy Channel ID (CHANNEL_ID)` and record it.
3. Open [Discord Developer Platform](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
4. Create a new application-Bot, which is `COZE-BOT`, and record the `token` and `id (COZE_BOT_ID)` specific to this bot. This bot will be the bot to be managed by coze.
5. Create a new application-Bot, which is `CDP-BOT`, and record the `token (BOT_TOKEN)` specific to this bot. This bot is the bot that listens to discord messages.
6. Both bots open corresponding permissions (`Administrator`) and invite them into the created discord server (the process is not detailed here).
7. Open [Discord official website](https://discord.com/app), enter the server, press F12 to open the developer tool, send a message in any channel, find the request `https://discord.com/api/v9/channels/1206*******703/messages` in Developer Tools-`Network`, get `Authorization(USER_AUTHORIZATION)` from the header of this interface and record it.
8. Open [Coze official website](https://www.coze.com) to create a bot and make personalized settings (note `Auto-Suggestion` is `Default/on` (default does not need to be changed)).
9. After the configuration is completed, choose to publish to discord, fill in the `token` of `COZE-BOT`, after the publication is completed, you can see `COZE-BOT` online and can be used in the discord server.
10. Use the parameters recorded above to start configuring [environment variables](#Environment Variables)and [deploy](#Deployment) this project.
11. Visit the API documentation address, you can start debugging or integrating other projects.

## Deployment

### Deployment Based on Docker-Compose (All In One)

```shell
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```docker
version: '3.4'

services:
  coze-discord-proxy:
    image: deanxv/coze-discord-proxy:latest
    container_name: coze-discord-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "7077:7077"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data
    environment:
      - USER_AUTHORIZATION=MTA5OTg5N************uIfytxUgJfmaXUBHVI  # Must be modified to our discord user's authorization key (multiple please separate by ,)
      - BOT_TOKEN=MTE5OTk2************wUrUWNbG63w  # Must be modified to the Bot-Token that listens to messages
      - GUILD_ID=11************96  # Must be modified to the server ID where the two robots are located
      - COZE_BOT_ID=11************97  # Must be modified to the robot ID managed by coze
      - CHANNEL_ID=11************24  # [Optional] Default channel-(This parameter is only used to activate the robot in the current version)
      - PROXY_SECRET=123456  # [Optional] Interface key-Modify this line to the value of the request header check (multiple please separate by ,)
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
```

### Deployment Based on Docker

```docker
docker run --name coze-discord-proxy -d --restart always \
-p 7077:7077 \
-v $(pwd)/data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data \
-e USER_AUTHORIZATION="MTA5OTg5N************uIfytxUgJfmaXUBHVI" \
-e BOT_TOKEN="MTE5OTk2************rUWNbG63w" \
-e GUILD_ID="11************96" \
-e COZE_BOT_ID="11************97" \
-e PROXY_SECRET="123456" \
-e CHANNEL_ID="11************24" \
-e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
deanxv/coze-discord-proxy
```

Where `USER_AUTHORIZATION`,`BOT_TOKEN`,`GUILD_ID`,`COZE_BOT_ID`,`PROXY_SECRET`,`CHANNEL_ID` are replaced with your own.

If the above image cannot be pulled, you can try using GitHub's Docker image, just replace the above `deanxv/coze-discord-proxy`with `ghcr.io/deanxv/coze-discord-proxy`.

Using your own may effectively prevent being banned. If not set, the author's default will be used. It is recommended to use this environment variable.
18. `NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=6232***********Niz9c` [Optional] Functions as the token for the TelegramBot notification (Notification events include: 1. Unavailability of user_authorization; 2. Risk control trigger by the BOT associated with BOT_TOKEN)
19. `NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_USER_ID=10******35` [Optional] The Telegram-Bot linked with NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN forwards notifications to the Telegram-User associated with this variable (This variable must not be empty when NOTIFY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is populated)
20. `PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10801` - [Optional] Proxy (only supports http)

## Advanced Configuration

### Configure Multiple Bots

1. Before deployment, create a `data/config/bot_config.json` file in the same directory as the `docker`/`docker-compose`deployment
2. Write this `json` file, the format of `bot_config.json` is as follows

```shell
[
  {
    "proxySecret": "123", // Interface request key (PROXY_SECRET) (Note: This key exists in the environment variable PROXY_SECRET so that this Bot can be matched!)
    "cozeBotId": "12***************31", // coze-managed bot ID
    "model": ["gpt-3.5","gpt-3.5-16k"], // Model name (array format) (corresponds to the model in the request parameter, if the model in the request does not match this json, it will throw an exception)
    "channelId": "12***************56"  // [Optional] discord channel ID (the robot must be in the server of this channel) (in the current version, this parameter is only used to activate the robot)
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "456",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************64",
    "model": ["gpt-4","gpt-4-16k"],
    "channelId": "12***************78"
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "789",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************12",
    "model": ["dall-e-3"],
    "channelId": "12***************24"
  }
]
```

3. Restart the service

> When there is this json configuration, it will match the `cozeBotId` in this configuration through the [request key]
> carried in the request header + `model` in the request body. If multiple matches are found, one will be randomly
> selected. The configuration is very flexible and can be configured according to your own needs.

The service deployed on a third-party platform (such as: `zeabur`) needs to [configure multiple bots]Please refer to [issue#30](https://github.com/deanxv/coze-discord-proxy/issues/30)

## Limitations

The current version of coze has implemented identification for each Discord user, and there is a usage limit for each user per different model on Discord, specifically as follows:

```
GPT-4 Turbo (128k) - 50 times/day
GPT-4 (8k) - 100 times/day
GPT-3.5 (16k) - 500 times/day
```

Multiple Discord user `Authorization` can be configured (refer to the [environment variable](#Environment-Variables) `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) to achieve cumulative request times and load balancing for requests.

## Q&A

Q: How to configure when the concurrency is high?

A: First, [configure multiple bots](#Configure-Multiple-Bots) for the service to serve as the response bot load, and then prepare multiple discord accounts to serve as the request load and invite them into the same server, get the `Authorization` of each account and separate them with English commas. Configure in the environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`, at this time each request will take out one from multiple discord accounts to initiate a conversation, effectively achieving load balancing.
