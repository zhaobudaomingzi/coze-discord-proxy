## Features (The project's features are now stable, updates will not be frequent, feel free to raise an issue if you find bugs!)

- [x] Perfectly compatible with `NextChat`, `one-api`, `LobeChat` and other conversation panels.
- [x] Perfect support for conversation isolation.
- [x] Conversation interface supports streaming responses.
- [x] Supports creating `discord` categories/channels/threads.
- [x] Supports conversation interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (also supports `dall-e-3` text-to-image) (supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports image-to-text/image-to-image/file-to-text interfaces aligned with `openai` (`v1/chat/completions`) (following the `GPT4V` interface request format [ supports `url` or `base64` ])(supports specifying `discord-channel`).
- [x] Supports `dall-e-3` text-to-image interface aligned with `openai` (`v1/images/generations`).
- [x] Supports daily `9 AM` scheduled tasks to keep the bot active.
- [x] Supports configuring multiple discord user `Authorization` (environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) for request load balancing (**currently each discord user has a 24-hour limit on coze-bot calls, configure multiple users to stack request counts and balance load**).
- [x] Supports configuring multiple coze bots for response load balancing (specified through `PROXY_SECRET`/`model`), see [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) for details.

## How to Use

1. Open [Discord's official website](https://discord.com/app), log in, click settings-advanced settings-developer mode-turn on.
2. Create a discord server, right-click this server to select `Copy Server ID (GUILD_ID)` and record it, create a default channel in this server, right-click this channel to select `Copy Channel ID (CHANNEL_ID)` and record it.
3. Open [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
4. Create a new application-Bot, i.e., `COZE-BOT`, and record its unique `token` and `id (COZE_BOT_ID)`, this bot will be managed by coze.
5. Create a new application-Bot, i.e., `CDP-BOT`, and record its unique `token (BOT_TOKEN)`, this bot will listen for discord messages.
6. Grant corresponding permissions (`Administrator`) to both bots and invite them to the created discord server (the process is not described here).
7. Open [Discord's official website](https://discord.com/app), enter the server, press F12 to open developer tools, send a message in any channel, find the request `https://discord.com/api/v9/channels/1206*******703/messages` in developer tools-`Network`, get `Authorization (USER_AUTHORIZATION)` from the header of this interface and record it.
8. Open [Coze's official website](https://www.coze.com), create and configure a bot (note `Auto-Suggestion` should be `Default/on` (usually no need to change)).
9. After configuration, choose to publish to discord, fill in the `token` of `COZE-BOT`, after publishing, you can see `COZE-BOT` online and can be used with @ in the discord server.
10. Start configuring [environment variables](#environment-variables) and [deploy](#deployment) this project using the recorded parameters.
11. Visit the API documentation address, and you can start debugging or integrating other projects.

    container_name: coze-discord-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "7077:7077"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data
    environment:
      - USER_AUTHORIZATION=MTA5OTg5N************aXUBHVI  # Must modify to your discord user's authorization key (multiple keys separated by commas)
      - BOT_TOKEN=MTE5OT************UrUWNbG63w  # Must modify to the listening bot's token
      - GUILD_ID=11************96  # Must modify to the server ID where both bots are located
      - COZE_BOT_ID=11************97  # Must modify to the bot ID managed by coze
      - CHANNEL_ID=11************94  # [Optional] Default channel - (currently this parameter is only used to keep the bot active)
      - PROXY_SECRET=123456  # [Optional] API key - modify this line to the value used for request header verification (multiple keys separated by commas)

```

### Deploying with Docker

```docker
docker run --name coze-discord-proxy -d --restart always \
-p 7077:7077 \
-v $(pwd)/data:/app/coze-discord-proxy/data \
-e USER_AUTHORIZATION="MTA5OTg5N************uIfytxUgJfmaXUBHVI" \
-e BOT_TOKEN="MTE5OTk2************rUWNbG63w" \
-e GUILD_ID="11************96" \

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Multiple Bots

1. Before deployment, create a `data/config/bot_config.json` file in the same directory as the `docker`/`docker-compose` deployment
2. Write the `json` file, `bot_config.json` format as follows

```shell
[
  {
    "proxySecret": "123", // API request key (PROXY_SECRET) (Note: this key must exist in the environment variable PROXY_SECRET for this Bot to be matched!)
    "cozeBotId": "12***************31", // Bot ID managed by coze
    "model": ["gpt-3.5","gpt-3.5-16k"], // Model names (array format) (if the model in the request does not match any in this json, an exception will be thrown)
    "channelId": "12***************56"  // [Optional] Discord channel ID (the bot must be in the server where this channel is located) (currently this parameter is only used to keep the bot active)
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "456",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************64",
    "model": ["gpt-4","gpt-4-16k"],
    "channelId": "12***************78"
  },
  {
    "proxySecret": "789",
    "cozeBotId": "12***************12",
    "model": ["dall-e-3"],
    "channelId": "12***************24"
  }
]
```

3. Restart the service

> When this json configuration is present, the bot will be matched through the [request key] carried in the request header and the [`model`] in the request body.
> If multiple matches are found, one will be randomly selected. The configuration is very flexible and can be adjusted according to your needs.

For services deployed on third-party platforms (such as `zeabur`) that need [configuring multiple bots], please refer to [issue#30](https://github.com/deanxv/coze-discord-proxy/issues/30)

## Limitations

Current details of coze's free and paid subscriptions: https://www.coze.com/docs/guides/subscription?_lang=en

You can configure multiple discord users `Authorization` (refer to [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) `USER_AUTHORIZATION`) or [configure multiple bots](#configuring-multiple-bots) to stack request counts and balance load.

## Q&A

Q: How should I configure for high concurrency?

A: First, [configure multiple bots](#configuring-multiple-bots) to serve as response bots. Secondly, prepare multiple discord accounts to serve as request load and invite them into the same server, obtain the `Authorization` for each account, separate them with commas, and configure them in the environment variable `USER_AUTHORIZATION`. Each request will then pick one discord account to initiate the conversation, effectively achieving load balancing.
